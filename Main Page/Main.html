                        who suits up in his armor of cutting-edge technology to become the super hero Iron Man.
                        The adopted son of weapons manufacturer Howard Stark,[48] Tony inherited his family's
                        company at
                        a young age following his parents'
                        death.[49] While overseeing a manufacturing plant in a foreign country, Stark was kidnapped
                        by
                        local terrorists. Instead of giving in to his captors' demands to build weapons for them,
                        Stark created a powerful suit of armor for himself to escape.
                        Returning to America, Stark further upgraded the armor and put his vast resources and
                        intellect
                        to use for the betterment of the world as Iron Man</p>

                    <p>Cpt. Steven "Steve" Rogers aka Captain America,
                        the First Avenger, was rejected by the U.S. Army
                        during World War II due to numerous health problems.
                        He ultimately volunteered for Project Rebirth where he received the Super Soldier Serum
                        developed by Dr. Abraham Erskine.
                        The serum greatly enhanced his frail body to the peak of human physicality. As the Sentinel
                        of
                        Liberty, alongside his best friend Bucky Barnes and the Invaders,
                        Rogers and others helped the allies win the war, but not before he was lost at sea and
                        frozen in
                        ice in a form of suspended animation for decades.
                        He was thawed out in the modern age to continue the battle alongside his new allies the
                        Avengers. Cap is loyal to no politician or government and instead upholds

                    <p>IThor is the "God of Thunder", a member of the race known as the Asgardians,
                        a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.
                        Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans
                        known
                        as Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology.
                        Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir, which helps him to channel his godly energies,
                        he
                        became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms.
                        When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard
                        (more
                        commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake, stripped
                        of
                        his memory.
                        After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers. Thor went on to
                        become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers,

                    <p>Dr. Bruce Banner, Ph.D. a.k.a. the Hulk is an American theoretical physicist,
                        famed for his work into the studies of nuclear physics and gamma radiation.
                        He was recruited by General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross and the US Army to develop the first
                        Gamma Bomb. During its first live test he was bombarded with a massive dose of gamma rays
                        while
                        saving Rick Jones,

                        personification of rage, fueled by pure physical strength and would come to be known as
                        nearly
                        mindless "Incredible Hulk".
