                    <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers,
                        and
                        the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as
                        a
                        genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional
                        technical
                        knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents
                        and
                        enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in
                        Afghanistan,
                        while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an
                        armored
                        suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors
                        to
                        use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Following his fight
                        against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.</p>

                        and
                        Earth's first known superhero. Rogers grew up suffering from numerous health problems, and upon
                        America's entry into World War II, he was rejected from serving in the United States Army
                        despite
                        several attempts to enlist. Rogers ultimately volunteered for Project Rebirth, where he was the

                        recipient of the Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific
                        Reserve. The serum greatly enhanced Rogers' physical abilities to superhuman levels. After
                        Erskine's
                        assassination and being doubted by SSR head director Chester Phillips, Rogers was relegated to

                        founding member of the Avengers. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited a
                        conflict
                        between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power,
                        and
                        banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, finding love with Jane
                        Foster, and helped save his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act
                        of
                        sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which
                        he
                        then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.</p>

                    <p>Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanoff (Russian: Наталья Альяновна "Наташа" Романов) was one of the
                        most talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a founding member of the Avengers. As
                        a
                        child, she was indoctrinated into the Red Room by General Dreykov, and briefly lived as the
                        surrogate daughter of Alexei Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff while they were undercover in the
                        United
                        States of America. After the Destruction of the North Institute, she underwent extensive
                        psychological conditioning, before graduating from the Red Room as a Widow. Working as an
                        operative
                        for the KGB, she was targeted by S.H.I.E.L.D., before given the chance to ultimately defect to
                        the
                        organization by Clint Barton by assassinating Dreykov. Romanoff succeeded, although having to
                        use
                        his daughter Antonia Dreykov's life as collateral damage would haunt her for the rest of her
                        life.

                        Banner was commissioned by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum that created
                        Captain

                        Banner was exposed to dangerous levels of gamma radiation (rather than vita radiation). As a
                        result,

                        as his primary weapon and an extremely keen eyesight and accuracy that earned him the codename

                    the latent mythical ability to harness Chaos Magic, she developed a hatred against Tony Stark and
                    rallied anti-American protests after the Novi Grad Bombings killed her parents. Years later, in an
                    effort to help purge their country of strife, the twins joined HYDRA and agreed to undergo
                    experiments with the Scepter under the supervision of Baron Strucker, with the Mind Stone awakening
                    and amplifying Wanda's powers. While her brother developed super-speed, she attained various psionic
                    abilities. When HYDRA fell, the twins joined Ultron to get their revenge on Stark, but abandoned him
                    when they discovered his true intentions to eradicate humanity. Wanda and Pietro joined the Avengers
                    during the Battle of Sokovia to stop Ultron; Pietro was killed during the battle but Wanda survived,
                    and shortly after relocated to the Avengers Compound in the United States of America.</p>

                    energy of the Tesseract via the destruction of the Light-Speed Engine, obtained cosmic powers. She
                    was made into a Kree-human hybrid via the blood transfusion from Yon-Rogg, while having all of her
                    old memories removed, turning her into the Kree's weapon and a member of Starforce. During the
                    Kree-Skrull War, Vers was captured by Skrulls, resulting in her returning to Earth and beginning to
                    recall her past, with help from Nick Fury and Maria Rambeau. Vers subsequently discovered that
                    Yon-Rogg and the Kree Empire had been manipulating her for years, learning from Talos that the
                    Skrulls were merely seeking to find a new home. With this information, Danvers, rejecting her Vers
                    persona, unlocked her true powers and defeated the Kree invasion onto Earth that was being led by
                    Ronan the Accuser, before setting off out to the far reaches of the galaxy to finish what her late
                    mentor Mar-Vell had previously started, honouring her by becoming known as Captain Marvel.</p>

                <p>Sergeant James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes is a World War II veteran, a former officer of the 107th
                    Infantry Regiment and the best friend of Steve Rogers since childhood. Barnes had enlisted into the
                    army and was assigned to the 107th in 1943. His regiment was captured by HYDRA, where Barnes was
                    given a variant of the Super Soldier Serum by Arnim Zola. Barnes, along with whoever still remained
                    from his regiment, was later rescued by Rogers, who had become Captain America during Barnes'
                    absence. Upon joining forces with the continuing war, Barnes and Rogers formed their Howling
                    Commandos, to battle Red Skull's forces. However, during the attempt to finally capture Zola out in
                    the Austrian Alps, Barnes was caught up in the ambush and plummeted hundreds of feet from a train.
                    As no body was ever recovered, Barnes had then been presumed deceased, becoming honoured as a hero.

                    suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. At this time, Wilson had met Steve Rogers and was
                    drawn to his conflict with HYDRA, as Rogers needed help from anyone not associated with S.H.I.E.L.D.
                    since they had been infiltrated by HYDRA. Retaking his old wings, Wilson had then assisted with
                    destroying all of Alexander Pierce's schemes of world domination. Following their victory against
                    Pierce's HYDRA units, Falcon then agreed to assist Rogers in tracking down the Winter Soldier, who
                    was in fact Rogers' close friend who had been brainwashed by HYDRA.</p>

                    as Carol Danvers, as the two fought off the Starforce, which was led by Yon-Rogg, as they were
                    targeting Skrull refugees. Fury took a liking to Goose who scratched him for violating her space and
